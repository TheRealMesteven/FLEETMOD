# AI Implementation Issues
Need to do a lot of Tab Menu reworking for bots as they require lots of buttons.
Potentially make the Bot page its own menu or make the tab menu scrollable so you can see each player on crew and kick them when desired.
Also probably should remove the keybind menu changing and replace with drop down where Auto targetting is or a custom page selector.
## Big Issues / Notes
- Host Ship AI break (Dont know what to do and end up standing in teleporter or restarting ship or mass pumping fuel) with multiple Captains. Not multiple ships.
- Having TWO AI crews makes them think there is an intruder and thus they patrol the ship rather than doing their duties.
- Other Ship having AI ONLY makes them think there is an intruder and thus they patrol the ship rather than doing their duties.
- Secondary Captain Breaks? 
(Ship on planet teleporters is the Admiral Ship, Top Right UI shows main ship in green, others white with no banners on any and sometimes have frozen mission accepted text.)
- Sometimes on joining it doesnt sync in.
## Small Issues / Notes
- AI can warp regardless of all ships lined up.
