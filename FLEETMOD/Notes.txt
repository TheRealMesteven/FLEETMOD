# AI Implementation Issues
Need to do a lot of Tab Menu reworking for bots as they require lots of buttons.
Potentially make the Bot page its own menu or make the tab menu scrollable so you can see each player on crew and kick them when desired.
Also probably should remove the keybind menu changing and replace with drop down where Auto targetting is or a custom page selector.
## Big Issues / Notes
- Bots of the same role act as one.
? - Sometimes on joining it doesnt sync in.
## Small Issues / Notes
- AI can warp regardless of all ships lined up.
- Bot Notifications Alert As Admiral
- On Warp AI on additional ships die
- Cant Access Bot Inventories
