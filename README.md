This is a mod for Pulsar Lost Colony, using the Pulsar Mod Loader
this plugin permits multiple crewed ships in one game, unfortunately without
individual warping, the mod creates a Fleet of player controlled ships.

Getting Started (Captain):
To create a new ship or assign a captain to a ship:
- Ensure you have 1+ Fleet-modded players
- Ensure you are at Outpost 448, W.D. Hub, The Estate, Cornelia, The Burrow, The Harbour or a Fluffy Biscuit Station. 
> Admiral uses the 'Fleet Manager' on the Comms.

Getting Started (Crew):
To change class or ship:
- Ensure the ship has a Captain!
> Open TAB
> Press '/'
> Select from the Captain which ship to crew and the role.

Known Issues:
- Captains can sometimes not be properly assigned their ships in the backend. Will only affect Ship Renaming.
- Ships that are Piloted when exiting warp collide with the host ship. No damage is caused due to brief godmode.
- Additional HP from surviving warp or using a revitalising syringe is not added to the players.
- Umbra Campaign and Ship will cause issues.
- Host exiting game will load forever.
- Sometimes scrap pickup can break in a sector. In this case, use the sensor dish.
- Sometimes additional ships cannot probe research materials.
- Sometimes if a crew ship is destroyed, players will see 'No Atrium'. This is only a visual bug!
- Ships that are not detected by the Admiral ship will have the ship name 'Ship Name'
- Captains Locker Name is of Host.
- Picked up components go to the Admiral ship.
- Warp range frequently does not increment properly.
- EXOTIC COMPONENTS and BETTER FRAGMENTS are NOT supported!
